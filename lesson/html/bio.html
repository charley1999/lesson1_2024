    <h2>All about Me</h2>
    <p>Some things to know about me are that I recently broke my left femur Skateboarding down hill and loosing control of the board. Going further back I graduated high school from Madison Central High School and continued into Landscaping at a company called Trisler Landscaping. I worked there for a few months before entering the US Army. I graduated basic training on the first try and continued on to my MOS training (that being the career training). Having waited four months for my training to start I decided to leave the military and soon followed into coding.</p>
